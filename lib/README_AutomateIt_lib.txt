#
# == LIB
#
# This is your AutomateIt project's "lib" directory. You can put custom
# plugins and convenience methods into this directory.
#
# For example, create a convenience method for geteting the time by
# creating a "lib/now.rb" file with the following contents:
#
#   def now
#     DateTime.now
#   end
#
# This will provide a "now" method that's available to your recipes,
# interactive shell or embedded interpreter.
#
# Libraries are loaded every time an AutomateIt interpreter is started.
# It loads all "*.rb" files in this directory, and all "init.rb" files
# in subdirectories of this directory.
